# Draw Together

A collaborative painting application.

The application consists of two parts:
1.) A BBS that displays recently completed paintings and allows other users to comment on them, fork them off and make their own edits, and play a speedpainting video of the artists' work.
2.) Built-in painting software. It should be lightweight, but allow a high degree of control. It should record every change made, so that other artists can replay the painting and watch the painter's process. In the future, it should allow realtime collaboration in addition to the BBS collaboration mentioned above.
